Freaky Fast Dash
====
This is a node.js application that "hacks" your [Amazon Dash Button](http://www.amazon.com/dashbutton) to order you a [Jimmy John](https://www.jimmyjohns.com/)'s sandwich!
This is a continuation of my button series where I already have hacked the Dash Button to order me [Domino's Pizza](https://github.com/bhberson/pizzadash) and [Drizly](https://github.com/bhberson/DrizlyDash) for alcohol!

One idea would be to have this [always running](#always-running) via a local server such as a Raspberry Pi and have on demand sandwich ordering whenever you just need a sub!

I am using Node module [dash-button](https://github.com/ide/dash-button) and [Jimmy-Johns](https://github.com/mmahler2/JimmyJohns).

Always Running
----
This [article](http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/) shows you what you can do with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to set this up as a node server running all the time on your network and it literally would be the press of a button *whenever* you wanted!

Or you can create an AWS Lambda function if you own an Amazon AWS IoT Button. They basically handle the "always on" use case for us!

To do
----
- Finish Project
- Come up with a Gist for AWS Lambda Function for Amazon AWS IoT Button.
